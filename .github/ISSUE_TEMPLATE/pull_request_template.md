# PR-Template 2

<!--- First, pick a good title.
-> Styleguide:
`[FRK-XXX] Verb short-title`
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
-> if there is no ticket, provide a short summary in the Title above.

Examples of good PR titles:

* "[FRK-XX] Add so-and-so models"
* "[NO-TICKET] Fix duplicates such-and-such"

Make sure the title is in good english.
This entails grammar (that you can check with https://www.grammarly.com, but also capitalisation that you can check with https://capitalizemytitle.com/)
